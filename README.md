# RADmapperExerciser
A web-based facility for experimenting with the [RADmapper language](https://github.com/pdenno/RADmapper) currently documented [here](https://github.com/pdenno/interop-mapping/blob/main/interop-mapping.pdf).

The implementation borrows heavily from [Nextjournal's clojure-mode](https://github.com/nextjournal/clojure-mode).
